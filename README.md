<h1>Minesweeper</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/3a7ZFwUxZdw) 

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an implementation of the famous Windows game known as Minesweeper. The game starts when the user clicks on a tile on the grid, prompting a flooding effect. The numbers in each tile indicate how many mines surround that tile. If the user clicks on a tile with a mine, the game ends. The user has the ability to reveal or flag tiles. The score is also kept track of throughout the duration of the game and is displayed once the game ends. Good luck!
